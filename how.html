            <p>Object detection is a subfield of computer vision that involves identifying and localizing 
                <br>objects of interest within an image or video. The COCO-SSD model is a pre-trained deep learning  
                <br>model that has been trained on the COCO dataset, which contains a wide variety of objects across 80 
                <br>different classes such as people, animals, vehicles, and everyday items.

                    <h2 class="red">Bounding Boxes localization</h2>
                    <p>The COCO-SSD model uses bounding boxes to outline the regions in an image where objects are located. Each bounding box is represented by four coordinates: (x, y) of the top-left corner and (width, height) of the box.</p>

                    <h2 class="green">Object Classification</h2>
                    <p>The model not only localizes objects but also assigns a class label to each detected object. This allows it to distinguish between different types of objects, such as <b>dog</b>, <b>bicycle</b>, <b>car</b>, and more.</p>

                    <p>COCO-SSD provides a confidence score for each detected object, indicating the model's level of certainty about the detection. Higher confidence scores indicate more reliable detections.</p>
